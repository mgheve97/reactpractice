## Projects

1. **React Practice 1**

   - Description: A Simple Introduction using React saying Hi and my name
   - Features: ReactDOM, Render, Unordered List, List

2. **React Practice 2**

   - Description: This project demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM directly using imperative programming. Below is an example of how to create and append an `h1` element:
     ```javascript
     const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
     h1.textContent = "This is an imperative way to program";
     h1.className = "Header";
     document.getElementById("root").append(h1);
     ```
   - Features: This project contrasts imperative programming with React's declarative approach to rendering UI components.

3. **React Practice 3**

   - Description: This project focuses on practicing the component-based architecture in React by creating three distinct components: `Nav`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`.
     - **Nav:** A navigation component that provides links to different sections of the application.
     - **MainContent:** The central area where the main content is displayed, demonstrating the rendering of dynamic data.
     - **Footer:** A footer component that contains additional information, such as copyright and links to social media.
   - Features: This project emphasizes the separation of concerns by modularizing the UI into reusable components, showcasing how each component interacts within the overall application layout.

4. **Cats Contact Practice**

   - Description: This project demonstrates how to use props in React to create reusable components with varying information. By passing different props to the same component, we can easily render multiple instances of the component while customizing the displayed data. This approach promotes efficient code organization and reduces redundancy.
   - Features: The project showcases a `CatCard` component that receives props such as `name`, `age`, and `breed`, allowing for the display of diverse information about different cats while using the same underlying component structure.

5. **Jokes Practice React**
   - Description: This project demonstrates how to utilize props to pass data between components in React. In this practice, I've created a component that calls jokes data from an external source. The jokes are structured as an array of objects, each containing a `setup` and a `punchline`.
   - Jokes Data:
     ```javascript
     export default [
       {
         setup: "I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday.",
         punchline: "I can't wait to see her face light up when she opens it.",
       },
       {
         setup: "How did the hacker escape the police?",
         punchline: "He just ransomware!",
       },
       {
         setup: "Why don't pirates travel on mountain roads?",
         punchline: "Scurvy.",
       },
       {
         setup: "Why do bees stay in the hive in the winter?",
         punchline: "Swarm.",
       },
       {
         setup: "What's the best thing about Switzerland?",
         punchline: "I don't know, but the flag is a big plus!",
       },
     ];
     ```
   - Features: The project highlights how to dynamically render jokes by mapping through the array and passing the data as props to the joke components, allowing for a seamless and interactive user experience.
